To create bibtex follow instructions from

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13545725/automatically-create-citations-list-for-personal-academic-site-from-bibtex

You can use pandoc's own citation support for this. Create a markdown file along the following lines:

# Peer-reviewed papers

1. [@me2001]
2. [@me2002]

# Non-peer-reviewed papers

1. [@me1999]
2. [@me1998]

where me1999 etc are the keys in your bibtex file. Then find or create a CSL file that formats the citations in the way you would like, and process with pandoc:

pandoc --bibliography mybiblio.bib --csl mycsl.csl -o citations.html -s citations.txt

Or you can add -t markdown and get a markdown version if you wish.
