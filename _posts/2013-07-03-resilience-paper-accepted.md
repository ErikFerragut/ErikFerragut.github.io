<p>My paper with Alex Melin, Roger Kisner, David Fugate, and Jason
Laska on foundational definitions was accepted at the International
Symposium on Resilient Control Systems (<a
href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/conferencedetails/index.html?Conf_ID=30909">ISRCS
2013</a>).  In the paper, we make rigorous the commonly accepted
non-rigorous definition of a resilient system as one that "maintains
state awareness and and acceptable level of operational normalcy in
response to disturbances including threats of an unexpected and
malicious nature" [1].  We do this by mathematically defining
resilience in terms of state awareness and operational normalcy.</p>
