<p>We are now hiring for a post-doctoral position in graph theory research.  You can find more about ORNL post-doc opportunities at <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/ornl/careers">ORNL's Job Site</a> by clicking on the Postdoctoral Positions button.  This particular posting can be found <a href="/pdfs/graph-theory-postdoc-oct-2013.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a snippet: ORNL is looking for a researcher with strong foundational knowledge of graph theory and successful experience developing graph algorithms and applying them to large data sets. This position requires innovative thinking about the nature of multi-scale decomposition and analysis of (potentially heterogeneous) graphs, both from theoretical and practical perspectives. Success will require new approaches to multi-scale massive network visualization, user interaction methods, integration of information visualization design with computational analytics, and evaluation methods.</p>
