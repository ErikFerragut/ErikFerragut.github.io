For example, if you wrote a blog post on March 8th, 2013 in the Markdown format and wanted a post “slug” of “best-spring-recipies”, you’d name your file 2013-03-08-best-spring-recipies.md.

## And
If you don’t know this already, the term “post slug” refers to a URL-friendly format for the post’s name. This means, no spaces, weird characters, and anything that isn’t normally allowed in a URL. Standard conventions include keeping all of the letters lower case, using dashes (“-“) instead of spaces, and using a relatively short slug.
