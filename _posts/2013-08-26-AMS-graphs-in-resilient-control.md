<p>My abstract has been approved for the AMS Southeastern Sectional meeting to be held on October 5 and 6, 2013.  I will be presenting my recent work with Alex Melin and Jason Laska of ORNL and Seddik Djouadi of UT-Knoxville.  We use the Jordan canonical form of a dynamics matrix to define a bipartite graph that embodies the resilience of a cyber physical system.  We then show that a natural statistic for resilience is, in fact, NP-complete to compute.  However, the most important part of it in terms of determining a good approximation of resilience, can be computed very quickly.</p>
