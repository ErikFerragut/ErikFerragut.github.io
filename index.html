  <div class="span9"> <br /> <p> I am a Director of Data Science in
     payment integrity for commercial clients
     at <a href="http://www.optum.com">Optum</a>, a part of
     UnitedHealth Group.  This means that I help create models to
     detect and help prevent fraud, waste, abuse, and error in medical
     billing for large healthcare clients.  Since labeled data can be
     limited, I am interested in combining unsupervised,
     semi-supervised, and supervised methods to achieve the best
     possible results.  More generally, I am interested in solving
     urgent, real world problems by applying state-of-the-art machine
     learning algorithms, inventing them when needed.
      </p>

    <p>One recent project was the creation of a supervised model that
     led to tens of millions of dollars in savings.  In other work, I
     modernized a large legacy code base consisting of tens of
     thousands of lines of PL/SQL code by creating a modern Python and
     PySpark implementation.  I also created a real-time version of
     the model by breaking out the computation into periodic
     computations and real-time look-ups.  I have planned and am
     executing on a roadmap of modeling improvements to include deep
     learning components within a model explainable in
     medical/clinical terms.</p>

    <p>In addition to my technical role, I also lead a small team of
     data scientists, directing their work, mentoring their technical
     development, and evaluating their performance.</p>
      
    <p>In the recent past, I worked on cyber security and
     cyber-physical security. Cyber systems have peculiarities that
     often require new algorithms. For example, much of the data
     collected is computer-generated, discrete, and structured. Also,
     many of the underlying structures are or occur within networks.
     Furthermore, these systems must operate in adversarial scenarios
     where simple fault tolerance and reliability analyses cannot
     properly account for the planning and intelligence of
     adversaries. I explored the development of new algorithms that
     exploit the particulars of cyber problems to improve defensive
     and offensive capabilities.  My later focus was on situation
     awareness from network sensor data and protection of the power
     grid.</p>

     <p>I worked at ORNL between 2009 and 2017.  In addition to being
      a research scientist, I was also the team lead for
      research-operations integration where I supported the
      operational deployment of research results. Previously, I worked
      as a cryptologic researcher for over 10 years. I earned my
      Ph.D. in Mathematics from
      the <a href="http://math.lsa.umich.edu">University of Michigan,
      Ann Arbor</a> in 2003 (defending my thesis just hours before
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Blackout_of_2003">Northeast
      blackout</a>).</p> </div>

  <h4>Research Interests</h4>
  <p> My research focus is in the effective use of machine learning
   methods to address real, operational problems. Many amazing results
   have been achieved recently using deep learning, but most of these
   are within the domains of images, voice, and text. In many
   applications, such as medical claims data and cyber security, the
   idiosyncrasies of the data render inappropriate the routine
   application of advanced algorithms. I am especially interested in
   determining the best analytics for addressing any given problem,
   whether it be from deep learning, other machine learning methods,
   optimization, probabilistic modeling, or game theory.
