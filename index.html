  <div class="span9"> <br /> <p> I am a Senior Data Scientist in the
     <a href="http://www.ioc.ornl.gov/">Cyber and Information Security
     Research Group</a> within the <a
     href="http://computing.ornl.gov">Computer and Computational
     Sciences Directorate</a> at the <a href="http://www.ornl.gov">Oak
     Ridge National Laboratory</a>. I am interested in solving urgent,
     real world problems by applying state-of-the-art machine learning
     algorithms, inventing them when needed. In this group, most of
     our applications are drawn from cyber security and cyber-physical
     security.
     However, cyber systems have peculiarities that often require new
     algorithms.  For example, much of the data collected is
     computer-generated, discrete, and structured.  Also, many of the
     underlying structures are or occur within networks.  Furthermore,
     these systems must operate in adversarial scenarios where simple
     fault tolerance and reliability analyses cannot properly account
     for the planning and intelligence of adversaries.  I am
     interested in developing new algorithms that exploit the
     particulars of cyber problems to improve defensive and offensive
     capabilities.  My recent focus has been on situation awareness
     from network sensor data and protection of the power grid.</p>

     <p>I have been at ORNL since 2009.  In addition to being a
    research scientist, I am also the team lead for
    research-operations integration where I support the operational
    deployment of research results. Previously, I worked as a
    cryptologic researcher for over 10 years. I earned my Ph.D. in
    Mathematics from the <a
    href="http://math.lsa.umich.edu">University of Michigan, Ann
    Arbor</a> in 2003 (defending my thesis just hours before the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Blackout_of_2003">Northeast
    blackout</a>).</p> </div>

<h4>Research Interests</h4> <p> My research focus is in the effective
  use of machine learning methods to address real, operational
  problems. Many amazing results have been achieved recently using
  Deep Learning, but most of these are within the domains of images,
  voice, and text. In many applications, such as cyber security, the
  idiosyncrasies of the data render inappropriate the routine
  application of advanced algorithms. I am especially interested in
  determining the best analytics for addressing any given problem,
  whether it be from Deep Learning, other machine learning methods,
  optimization, probabilistic modeling, or game theory.
