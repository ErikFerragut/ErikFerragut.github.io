  <div class="span9"> <br /> <p> I am a Principal Data Scientist in the
     Commercial Data Science team within the Advanced Analytics
     Laboratory at <a href="http://www.optum.com">Optum</a>, a part of
     UnitedHealth Group. I am interested in solving urgent,
     real world problems by applying state-of-the-art machine learning
     algorithms, inventing them when needed. In this group, my focus
     is on detection and prevention of fraud, waste, abuse, and error
     within medical claims data. Since labeled data can be limited, I
     am interested in combining unsupervised, semi-supervised, and
    supervised methods as appropriate.</p>

    <p>In the recent past, I worked on cyber security and
     cyber-physical security. Cyber systems have peculiarities that
     often require new algorithms. For example, much of the data
     collected is computer-generated, discrete, and structured. Also,
     many of the underlying structures are or occur within networks.
     Furthermore, these systems must operate in adversarial scenarios
     where simple fault tolerance and reliability analyses cannot
     properly account for the planning and intelligence of
     adversaries. I explored the development of new algorithms that
     exploit the particulars of cyber problems to improve defensive
     and offensive capabilities.  My later focus was on situation
     awareness from network sensor data and protection of the power
     grid.</p>

     <p>I worked at ORNL between 2009 and 2017.  In addition to being
    a research scientist, I was also the team lead for
    research-operations integration where I supported the operational
    deployment of research results. Previously, I worked as a
    cryptologic researcher for over 10 years. I earned my Ph.D. in
    Mathematics from the <a
    href="http://math.lsa.umich.edu">University of Michigan, Ann
    Arbor</a> in 2003 (defending my thesis just hours before the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Blackout_of_2003">Northeast
    blackout</a>).</p> </div>

<h4>Research Interests</h4> <p> My research focus is in the effective
  use of machine learning methods to address real, operational
  problems. Many amazing results have been achieved recently using
  Deep Learning, but most of these are within the domains of images,
  voice, and text. In many applications, such as medical claims data
  and cyber security, the
  idiosyncrasies of the data render inappropriate the routine
  application of advanced algorithms. I am especially interested in
  determining the best analytics for addressing any given problem,
  whether it be from Deep Learning, other machine learning methods,
  optimization, probabilistic modeling, or game theory.
